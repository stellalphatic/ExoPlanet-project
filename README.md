The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary systems, introducing us to a multitude of worlds beyond our solar system. Yet, access to this knowledge remains limited to those with specific resources. Our vision is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge astrophysical discoveries and the general public by creating an accessible, educational, and interactive tool that can visualize and interpret exoplanet data. By leveraging modern web technologies, our goal is to spark curiosity about space and the universe, making the study of exoplanets approachable for students, educators, and space enthusiasts alike.

This project envisions a world where:
- Every student has the opportunity to explore exoplanets and understand their potential for habitability.
- Interactive and engaging learning tools make space science accessible to underserved communities.
- Anyone can visualize and compare exoplanetary data to better appreciate the diversity of planetary systems.

We aim to fulfill these visions through the development of various applications
- A [web-based](https://exo-two.vercel.app/) interactive tool to create an immersive experience through visually engaging graphics
- An intuitive [mobile app](https://github.com/avexxx3/ExoVoyage) to help convey the statistical data in an easy to digest manner
- A powerful [chat-bot](https://chatbot-3.vercel.app/) designed to guide users through any questions that might pop up when pondering the vastness of the universe
- And finally, a robust backend to help provide all these services with the necessary information

At it's core, data is gathered from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/), which is then translated according to various metrics to give us an estimate on the odds of humans surviving on various exoplanets.
